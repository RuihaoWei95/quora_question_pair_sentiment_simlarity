# quora_question_pair_sentiment_simlarity
Quora has millions of users that post questions, and lots of these questions are similar.
Identifying these duplicated questions can provide a better experience for active seekers and
writers. Our project idea is to use the NLP technology we learned in class to identify semantic
similarities for these question pairs.
